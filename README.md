1.Our main focus is to investigate Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), which plays an active role in many cancers by controlling various signaling pathways. A lot of clinical trials and studies on mouse models observed that CK2 inhibition is needed in tumor cells as they use CK2 for survival. We want to investigate whether CK2 is expressed or co-expressed with certain other genes and also see if there are any implications of this protein in GBM tumors.Once we determine the spatial expression of CK2, we could see co-expressed genes,by checking whether other genes that are implicated in GBM are expressed in similar patterns.

2.Mainly use packages like seurat to deal with spatial images.
